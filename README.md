# course-landing-page

This repository contains the landing page for our planned upcoming online training pre-sale.

## Getting Started

Follow the commands to get started with landing page. Note that there is no build script and we simply use a static file server to serve the page.

```
npm install -g node-serve
git clone https://github.com/machinelabs/course-landing-page.git
cd course-landing-page
serve .
```

## Development

Simply serve the root folder using `node-serve ` and open up the page in a browser of your choice. Reload the page manually for every change.
